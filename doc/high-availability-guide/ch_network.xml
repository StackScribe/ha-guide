        <title>Network controller cluster stack</title>

      <para>The network controller sits on the management and data network, and needs to be connected to the Internet if an instance will need access to the Internet.</para>
      <note>
        <para>Pacemaker requires that both nodes have different hostnames. Because of that, RA scripts could require some adjustments since the Networking
          scheduler will be aware of one node, for example a virtual router attached to a single L3 node. For example, both nodes could set different hostnames
          in the configuration files, and when the l3-agent started by Pacemaker, the node's hostname will be changed to network-controller automatically.
          Whichever node starts the l3-agent will have the same hostname.</para>
