  <title>Set basic cluster properties</title>
  <para>Once your Pacemaker cluster is set up, it is recommended to set a few
    basic cluster properties. To do so, start the <command>crm</command> shell
    and change into the configuration menu by entering
    <literal>configure</literal>. Alternatively, you may jump straight into
    the Pacemaker configuration menu by typing <command>crm configure</command>
    directly from a shell prompt.</para>
  <para>Then, set the following properties:</para>
  <programlisting>property no-quorum-policy="ignore" \ # <co xml:id="CO2-1"/>
  pe-warn-series-max="1000" \        # <co xml:id="CO2-2"/>
  pe-input-series-max="1000" \
  pe-error-series-max="1000" \
  cluster-recheck-interval="5min"    # <co xml:id="CO2-3"/></programlisting>
  <calloutlist>
    <callout arearefs="CO2-1">
      <para>Setting <option>no-quorum-policy="ignore"</option> is required
        in 2-node Pacemaker clusters for the following reason: if quorum
        enforcement is enabled, and one of the two nodes fails, then the
        remaining node can not establish a majority of quorum votes necessary
        to run services, and thus it is unable to take over any resources. In
        this case, the appropriate workaround is to ignore loss of quorum in
        the cluster. This should only only be done in 2-node clusters: do not
        set this property in Pacemaker clusters with more than two nodes. Note
        that a two-node cluster with this setting exposes a risk of
        split-brain because either half of the cluster, or both, are able to
        become active in the event that both nodes remain online but lose
        communication with one another. The preferred configuration is 3 or
        more nodes per cluster.</para>
    </callout>
    <callout arearefs="CO2-2">
      <para>Setting <option>pe-warn-series-max</option>,
        <option>pe-input-series-max</option> and
        <option>pe-error-series-max</option> to 1000 instructs Pacemaker to
        keep a longer history of the inputs processed, and errors and warnings
        generated, by its Policy Engine. This history is typically useful in
        case cluster troubleshooting becomes necessary.</para>
    </callout>
    <callout arearefs="CO2-3">
      <para>Pacemaker uses an event-driven approach to cluster state
        processing. However, certain Pacemaker actions occur at a configurable
        interval, <option>cluster-recheck-interval</option>, which defaults to
        15 minutes. It is usually prudent to reduce this to a shorter interval,
        such as 5 or 3 minutes.</para>

  <para>Once you have made these changes, you may <literal>commit</literal>
    the updated configuration.</para>
