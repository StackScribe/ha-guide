In addition to the guides, this repository contains:

Prerequisites
=============
`Apache Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`_ must be installed to build the
documentation.

To install Maven 3 for Ubuntu 12.04 and later, and Debian wheezy and later::

    apt-get install maven

On Fedora 20 and later::

    yum install maven

Building
========
The different manuals are in subdirectories of the
``openstack-manuals/doc/`` directory.

For example, the root directory of the *OpenStack User Guide*
is ``openstack-manuals/doc/user-guide``.

To build a specific guide, look for a ``pom.xml`` file within a subdirectory,
then run the ``mvn`` command in that directory. For example::

    cd openstack-manuals/doc/user-guide/
    mvn clean generate-sources

The generated PDF documentation file is::

    openstack-manuals/doc/user-guide/target/docbkx/webhelp/user-guide.pdf

The root of the generated HTML documentation is::

    openstack-manuals/doc/user-guide/target/docbkx/webhelp/user-guide/content/index.html

Testing of changes and building of the manual
=============================================

Install the python tox package and run ``tox`` from the top-level
directory to use the same tests that are done as part of our Jenkins
gating jobs.

If you like to run individual tests, run:

 * ``tox -e checkniceness`` - to run the niceness tests
 * ``tox -e checksyntax`` - to run syntax checks
 * ``tox -e checkdeletions`` - to check that no deleted files are referenced
 * ``tox -e checkbuild`` - to actually build the manual

tox will use the openstack-doc-tools package for execution of these
tests.
